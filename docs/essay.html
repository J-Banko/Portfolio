        <p>Having now used both WordPress and the more "brick and mortar" html, there are definitely some significant differences in them. WordPress and sites like it are convenient in that they allow people who have no knowledge of how to code to create a decent looking and very well functioning website. However, you are at the mercy of a user interface that may or my not be super user friendly. You also cannot get as much customization out of something like WordPress.</p>
            
            <p>When you code a site using html, you can customize every aspect of it. You create the UI, you create the content, you order the content, you have full control over how something can look as opposed to being forced into some set presets. Overall HTML just provides more customization. There is also a sense of pride in the website when you create it from the ground up.</p>
