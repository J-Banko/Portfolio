        <h1>Zero Visibility</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The game is a linear, 3D not-quite-adventure game. The player uses mouse 1 to interact with interactable objects and WASD or the arrow keys to navigate through the world. The player follows the game's set path and finds various notes and other objects that move the plot forward. The game's setting is a snowy mountain. The player initially navigates the world in the character's car but eventually takes control of the whole group on foot. The player also will interact with signs, notes, and markings, which serve to forward the plot, throughout the rest of the game</p>
        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>The game opens with four friends (Elaine, Leo, Sarah, and Boyd) driving up a mountain to a hot spring. A sudden winter storm comes in. The friends debate turning back but elect to continue on. Boyd votes that, if it comes to it, they eat Leo first. He believes they could get a "nice, marbled steak" out of Leo (and maybe a chili, Boyd mused). They come to a street sign and exit the car to try to read it. They walk uo to it and find that it's all scratched out. They get back in the car to continue on. They realize that the fuel tank is leaking and they run out of fuel. They elect to continue on foot. They come across two firetrucks in front of a landslide. The firefighters are not present but they see fresh footprints in the snow and follow them. They find some red, glowing obelisks and get freaked out and turn around. When they try to go back the way they came, they find their way blocked by a solid stone wall. Suspecting something strange is going on the group continues on in an attempt to find shelter. As they walk, Sarah stops and seems to have a vision of a demonic place. As they continue they come across a pile of rocks. On the pile there is a note that says: </p>
            <p>"Please send help. One of us is injured and the blizzard is only getting worse. There are fresh footprints in the snow, but we've searched for hours and haven't found a soul. We tried to retrace our steps but we can't find the way out. We've been waiting for a search party, but with this weather I don't think it's coming. The bridge is damaged, but we think we can fix it. If you find this note, we've gone on ahead. Maybe we'll find a way off this damned mountain."</p>

        <p>They continue on and come across the rickety bridge. They begin crossing it and Sarah gets another demonic vision. Continuing on they find another note:</p>
        <p>"I don't know how long I've been here. Weeks? Years? Time doesn't have meaning here. The snownever stops. There's no day or night. Fires never stop burning, foorprints never fade. I'm freezing, I have no food, but I'm still alive. I found a note on the other side of the bridge, whoever wrote it seems to have vanished without a trace. Maybe they went on ahead. Or maybe they were rescued. There's no way back, all the paths are blocked. I want to keep moving forward, I feel like I need to, but it doesn't make any sense. I don't trust the feeling. It's... false.I should be waiting for rescue, or looking for food. Not going further up the mountain. But I need to reach the peak. I need to understand. Please find me. I'm so alone.</p>
        
        <p>They continue on and find a shack a small way further down the path. The group comments on how they finally have some good luck. Simultaneously, something comes behind the group and snatches the furthest member back, Elaine. Sarah says it seems to have dragged her down into the snow. They knock on the door of the shack and yell out asking for help of a phone. A silhouette in the window answers, "Leave. I don't have a phone." The group persists and the silhouette says that they have a gun and if they leave no one gets hurt. The man opens the window and yells at them to leave. He then realizes that they're just a bunch of kids. He warns them not to go looking for their friend. He says the thing that took Elaine will only attack if they try to reach the peak. They decide to ignore the man's advice and continue up the mountain and come across another note:</p>
        
        <p>"We've decided to take the only open route, it leads further up the mountain. We'll keep moving until we find a path to take us back down. At least, that's my plan. The others are behaving... strangley. Almost like they've given up on rescue, or even finding our own way home. All they talk about is reaching the top of the mountain. Maybe there's something in the air, a hallucinagen or something. Or maybe it's just the hunger and the cold. It might be getting to me too -- I've been seeing a silhouette, just out of sight of the fog. I haven't gotten a good look at it yet, any time I catch a glimpse it disappears. At first I thought it was a mountain lion, but now I'm not convinced. There's intelligence there. Like we're being investigated. Like it's waiting to see what we do. The further we move up the mountain the closer it gets. Maybe it's just a hallucination, but I'm starting to think moving forward isn't such a good idea. I don't trust the others anymore, but I can't bring myself to split up with that thing out there in the fog. Please find us. I don't want to die up here."</p>
        
        <p>After they read the note, they continue on and Leo immediately gets snatched by the shadow figure. Boyd and Sarah argue about what to do but ultimately decide to move forward. They come across a camp. The fire is still going but they make the observation that they camp's occupents were pulled from their tents. They find another note:</p>
        
        <p>"Holy shit, I can't believe we found it. It's more incredible than I could have imagined. Our measurements were correct. The gravitational fluctuations are much stronger than our initial calculations. Time is warped here beyond any currently understood scientific explanation. Whatever this place is seems to have been floating through spaceand time since long before the birth of our sun. What are the chances of it crossing Earth? Trillions to one?"</p>
        
        <p>Slightly further down the path, they find another note:</p>
        
        <p>"Emma, I don't feel cold anymore. I don't feel much of anything really the bridge still isn't done. I don't know how long I've been here. Ben and Drew are gone. Whatever those things are took them. I made graves for them, it felt like the right thing to do. I wonder if someone will make a grave for me too. -Adam"</p>
        
        <p>After passing the note they step onto another bridge. Sarah sees dozens of dead bodies below the bridge, seemingly haven fallen to their deaths.</p>
        
        <p>Next note. Found next to a graveyard:</p>
        
        <p>"Rest in peace, Adam. Everyone deserves a proper burial."</p>
        
        <p>They continue on. Finding another burial ground. Boyd says "Sarah, I don't think we're supposed to be here." Noting that the place feels threatening. They continue and find another note outside of what can only be described as looking like the gates of Hell.</p>
        
        <p>"My companions refused to believe. That's why they were taken - they lacked faith. God brought us here. We were chosen. And they didn't live up to expectations. I've never been the religious type, but this place is all the proof I need. I don't know what kind of God lies at theend of this path, but I can't deny it's power. I've seen it with my own two eyes. And I'm choosing to believe.</p>
        
        <p>As they walk throughthe gates, Boyd gets snatched by the shadow figure, leaving Sarah alone. She continues on and sees artwork depicting occult rituals. Passing out the other side of the room, Sarah comes across several skeletons impaled on pikes. She finds another note:</p>
        
        <p>"The architecture is incredible, I've never seen anything like it. No human built this. There's some sort of being up ahead. The others call it God, but I don't think that's the right word. It's... incredible. Unknowable. And the creature hunting us doesn't want us to reach it. I don't know how. But I can feel it -- I'm almost there. We live our lives searching for something incredible, something unique. Something worth dying for. That's what's at the end of this path. Something worth dying for. And if I keep pushing forward I'll be the first to see it. I know it's worth it. It has to be worth it. -Christine Rowe, 1936"</p>
        
        <p>Continuing on, she finds more skeletons and another note.</p>
        
        <p>"I killed one of them. One of those "monsters" following us. They move faster than anything I've ever seen, but they bleed red just like us. There should only be one left now. After I finish the bridge I'll hunt it down and kill it too. Anything that stands between us and God needs to be extinguished."</p>
        
        <p>Sarah comes across an unfinished bridge and finishes it. She finds more skeletons and the bodies of her friends impaled on pikes. The "demon" that snatched them says some unintelligible things to her. Sarah grabs it and beats it to death with the hammer she finished the bridge with. It does indeed bleed red. Sarah walks past her friends and into a cave. Inside the cave is a giant humanoid figure hung upside down with its arms outstretched and bound by chains. There is an all seeing eye behind it and psychedelic colors all around it.</p>
        
        <p>"I finally made it. It's... incredible. They were right. It was worth it. It was all worth it -"</p>
        
        <p>The unknown being says something unintelligible. Sarah screams and is disintegrated. The being seems to suck up her life-force. When this happens the chains break and it is released upon the world. The ending cinematic shows high winds and sudden freezing, implying that Sarah was the key that brought about the end of days.</p>
        
        <p>The game finishes with a title card.</p>
