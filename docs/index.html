        <p>Hey there! Welcome to my website! Glad you could be here.</p>
        
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>If you didn't already know, my name is Justin Banko. I am 21 years old and in my junior year at Penn State Behrend. This year I discovered the DIGIT major and fell in love with it. It allows me to scratch that creative itch and have the freedom to determine how I do it.</p>
        
        <h3>My Journey to DIGIT</h3>
        <p>I started college here at Penn State Behrend intending to major in Risk Management and
            transferring to University Park following the completion of my second year. Due to a
            variety of factors I eventually decided to stay here at Behrend. During my time here,
            I've tried a multitude of major programs to try to find the right fit for me. These are
            listed below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Risk Management</li>
            <li>Management Information Systems</li>
            <li>Planetary Science and Astronomy</li>
            <li>Interdisciplinary Business with Engineering Studies</li>
        </ol>
