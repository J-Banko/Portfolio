        <p>Hey there! Welcome to my website! Glad you could be here.</p>
               
        <h2>My Journey to DIGIT</h2>
        <p>I started college here at Penn State Behrend intending to major in Risk Management and transferring to University Park following the completion of my second year. Due to some mental health issues my grades suffered and thus I was unable to transfer. Since then I've looked into and tried several majors. Some of those are listed below.</p>
        
        
        
        
        <ol>
            <li>Risk Management</li>
            <li>Management Information Systems</li>
            <li>Planetary Science and Astronomy</li>
            <li>Interdisciplinary Business with Engineering Studies</li>
        </ol>
